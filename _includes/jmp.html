            This paper studies a class of models for two-sided interactions, where outcomes depend on latent characteristics of two distinct agent types. Models in this class have two core elements: the matching network, which records which agent pairs interact, and the interaction function, which maps latent characteristics of these agents to outcomes and determines the role of complementarities. I introduce the Tukey model, which captures complementarities with a single interaction parameter, along with two extensions that allow richer complementarity patterns. First, I establish an identification trade-off between the flexibility of the interaction function and the density of the matching network: the Tukey model is identified under mild conditions, whereas the more flexible extensions require dense networks that are rarely observed in applications. Second, I propose a cycle-based estimator for the Tukey interaction parameter and show that it is consistent and asymptotically normal even when the network is sparse. Third, I use its asymptotic distribution to construct a formal test of no complementarities. Finally, an empirical illustration shows that the Tukey model recovers economically meaningful complementarities.
