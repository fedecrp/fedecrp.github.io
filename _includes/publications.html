            Threshold policies are decision rules that assign treatments based on whether an observable characteristic exceeds a certain threshold. They are widespread across multiple domains, including welfare programs, taxation, and clinical medicine. This paper examines the problem of designing threshold policies using experimental data, when the goal is to maximize the population welfare. First, I characterize the regret â€“ a measure of policy optimality â€“ of the Empirical Welfare Maximizer (EWM) policy, popular in the literature. Next, I introduce the Smoothed Welfare Maximizer (SWM) policy, which improves the EWMâ€™s regret convergence rate under an additional smoothness condition. The two policies are compared by studying how differently their regrets depend on the population distribution, and investigating their finite sample performances through Monte Carlo simulations. In many contexts, the SWM policy guarantees larger welfare than the EWM. An empirical illustration demonstrates how the treatment recommendations of the two policies may differ in practice.

            The causal inference model proposed by Lee (2008) for the regression discontinuity design (RDD) relies on assumptions that imply the continuity of the density of the assignment (running) variable. The test for this implication is commonly referred to as the manipulation test and is regularly reported in applied research to strengthen the design's validity. The multidimensional RDD (MRDD) extends the RDD to contexts where treatment assignment depends on several running variables. This paper introduces a manipulation test for the MRDD. First, it develops a theoretical model for causal inference with the MRDD, which is used to derive a testable implication on the conditional marginal densities of the running variables. Then, it constructs the test for the implication based on a quadratic form of a vector of statistics separately computed for each marginal density. Finally, the proposed test is compared with alternative procedures commonly employed in applied research.
