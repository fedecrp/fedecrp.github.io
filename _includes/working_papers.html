            The causal inference model proposed by Lee (2008) for the regression discontinuity design (RDD) relies on assumptions that imply the continuity of the density of the assignment (running) variable. The test for this implication is commonly referred to as the manipulation test and is regularly reported in applied research to strengthen the design's validity. The multidimensional RDD (MRDD) extends the RDD to contexts where treatment assignment depends on several running variables. This paper introduces a manipulation test for the MRDD. First, it develops a theoretical model for causal inference with the MRDD, which is used to derive a testable implication on the conditional marginal densities of the running variables. Then, it constructs the test for the implication based on a quadratic form of a vector of statistics separately computed for each marginal density. Finally, the proposed test is compared with alternative procedures commonly employed in applied research.

            This paper considers the problem of ranking objects based on their latent merits using data from pairwise interactions. Existing approaches rely on the restrictive assumption that all the interactions are either observed or missed randomly. We investigate what can be inferred about rankings when this assumption is relaxed. First, we demonstrate that in parametric models, such as the popular Bradley-Terry-Luce model, rankings are point-identified if and only if the tournament graph is connected. Second, we show that in nonparametric models based on strong stochastic transitivity, rankings in a connected tournament are only partially identified. Finally, we propose two statistical tests to determine whether a ranking belongs to the identified set. One test is valid in finite samples but computationally intensive, while the other is easy to implement and valid asymptotically. We illustrate our procedure using Brazilian employer-employee data to test whether male and female workers rank firms differently when making job transitions.

          Even though data on hospital admissions are widely used in health research, hospitalization-related quantities measured using these data are not always clearly conceptualized. Consequently, estimators of these quantities can have unclear rationales and undesirable properties. We evaluate three rate estimators for measuring hospitalization-related quantities that are of interest in health economics and clinical medicine subspecialities. Using the Grossman human capital model, we motivate the importance of measuring healthy time. We show that an upper bound on healthy time can be calculated using lengths of hospital stay without assumptions about health status outside the hospital. We find that an admission rate conventionally used in clinical research is a patient follow-up time weighted average that lacks a clear basis for the weights. We evaluate the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) use of risk-standardized readmission rates to penalize hospitals under the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) and find that it may inadvertently conflict with disease-specific care aimed at reducing mortality risk. We show that risk-standardized rates can be sensitive to patient case mix, potentially leading to hospital rankings that do not reflect hospital quality. We also summarize debates regarding the effectiveness of risk-standardized readmission rates in reducing readmissions.
