            This paper considers the problem of ranking objects based on their latent merits using data from pairwise interactions. We allow for incomplete observation of these interactions and study what can be inferred about rankings in such settings. First, we show that identification of the ranking depends on a trade-off between the tournament graph and the interaction function: in parametric models, such as the Bradley-Terry-Luce, rankings are point identified even with sparse graphs, whereas nonparametric models require dense graphs. Second, moving beyond point identification, we characterize the identified set in the nonparametric model under any tournament structure and represent it through moment inequalities. Finally, we propose a likelihood-based statistic to test whether a ranking belongs to the identified set. We study two testing procedures: one is finite-sample valid but computationally intensive; the other is easy to implement and valid asymptotically. We illustrate our results using Brazilian employer-employee data to study how workers rank firms when moving across jobs.

          We propose a new manipulation test for a Boundary Discontinuity Design, i.e., an RDD with a d-dimensional running variable. Our approach avoids multivariate density estimation and builds on the intuition that, without manipulation, treated and control units should occur with equal frequency near almost all boundary points. We establish the asymptotic validity of our test under suitable conditions. We assess the finite-sample performance of the test through Monte Carlo simulations and illustrate its usefulness in three empirical applications.
